# Buka buka

[![Build Status](https://github.com/weblab-staff/Bukabuka/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weblab-staff/Bukabuka/actions)

This is Buka buka: 🐢. Buka buka loves questions from weblab students. No questions make buka buka sad. You don't want to make Bukabuka sad.

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run start`
4. (In another terminal) `npm run start:client`

By default, the server uses port 3000 and the client uses port 8080. The client proxies request from '/api' to the server.
