# Buka buka

[![Build Status](https://github.com/weblab-staff/Bukabuka/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weblab-staff/Bukabuka/actions)

This is Buka buka: 🐢. Buka buka loves questions from weblab students. No questions make buka buka sad. You don't want to make Bukabuka sad.

### This is over-engineered.

I know, but Bukabuka deserves the best.

## Setup

You can reference [Architecture.md](Architecture.md) for further instructions, but for a quick setup:

1. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn run start:server`
4. (In another terminal) `yarn run start:client`

**Note**
We are not using npm, we are using yarn. So whenever adding a package / dependency, use yarn add <package>.
