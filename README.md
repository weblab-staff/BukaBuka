# Buka buka

Buka buka loves questions from weblab students. No questions make buka buka sad. You don't want to make Bukabuka sad.

### This is over-engineered.

I know, but Bukabuka deserves the best.

## Setup

You can reference Architecture.md for further instructions, but for a quick setup:

1. Install yarn
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn run start:server`
4. (In another terminal) `yarn run start:client`
